      <h1>Welcome to the Carleton Tunnel Game!</h1>
      <h2> 
        Note: We understand that marks will be lost for this, but please DO NOT USE MOBILE! The game is designed for a landscape orientation, and the use of the WASD keys.
        <br/>
        Carl had a late Psych Tutorial at Loeb, and needs to go back to his dorm to sleep at Leeds House. Unfortunately, he forgot his coat, and it's mid-February, and the weather is a strong blizzard with -30 degree winds. You will have to answer these trivia questions told by the Carleton Raven to get to your dorm. If you fail, you will be sent outside to freeze to death.
        <br/>
        Please follow the Move directions with WASD, in order to guide Carl in the right direction, as he is a first year student, and has awful spatial skills.
        Have Fun!!!
        <br/>
